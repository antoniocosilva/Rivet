# This is _total_ energy of beams, so this becomes 197*200=39400 etc.
#Energies: [1516.9, 2265.5, 2856.5, 3861.2, 5319, 7683, 12292.8, 39400]
Description:
  'Calibration of the centrality percentile using charged particles at central rapidity ($\eta < 0.5$)'
ToDo:
 - Implement the analysis, test it, remove this ToDo, and mark as VALIDATED :-)
